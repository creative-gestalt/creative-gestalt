## Hi there 👋
#### I have some personal projects on here and larger projects on Jetbrains Space. I prefer using all things Jetbrains 😉

#### 🔭 I'm currently working on planning a cross-platform application.
#### 💻 I manage 2 live web applications and 5 personal web applications, all used by many users.
#### 🐳 I prefer containerization of my applications using Docker and my own custom images, making them sharable and fast.
